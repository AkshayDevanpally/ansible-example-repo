# ======================================================
# ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:
# This playbook demonstrates how to use `local_action` to 
# create a file on the Ansible **control node (local machine)**,
# and then transfer that file to a **remote host** using the `copy` module.
# ======================================================

- name: Local Action in Ansible
  hosts: all                    # Run this play on all inventory hosts
  remote_user: ec2-user         # Use ec2-user to connect to the remote host
  become: 'yes'                 # Run tasks with elevated privileges (sudo)
  become_user: root             # Specifically become the root user

  tasks:
    - name: This will create a local file /tmp/local_file.ini
      local_action:             # This task runs on the control node (not remote host)
        module: command         # Use the `command` module locally
        argv:
          - touch
          - "/tmp/{{ ansible_hostname }}_local_file.ini"
      # The file will be named with the current host's hostname for uniqueness

    - name: Here we copy the local file to remote 
      copy:
        src: /tmp/{{ ansible_hostname }}_local_file.ini  # Path on the control node
        dest: /var/tmp/                                  # Destination on the remote host
        # This uses the `copy` module which pushes the local file to remote server
