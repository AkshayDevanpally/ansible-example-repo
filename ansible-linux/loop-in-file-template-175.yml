# üìù Playbook Explanation:
#
# ‚û§ This playbook installs and configures Nginx on all 
#    servers in the 'webservers' inventory group.
#
# ‚û§ It uses a Jinja2 template (`nginx.conf.j2`) to 
#    generate the main Nginx config file dynamically 
#    based on the host's name and proxy targets.
#
# ‚û§ It ensures the service is installed, configured, 
#    started, and set to auto-start on boot.
#
# ‚û§ If the config file changes, a handler is triggered 
#    to reload the Nginx service (not restart) to apply 
#    the new settings smoothly.
#
# ‚û§ This setup is meant for Debian-family OSes. You can 
#    add conditions or tasks for other OS families (like 
#    RedHat) if needed.
#
# ‚û§ You must provide a valid `nginx.conf.j2` template file 
#    in your playbook directory or role templates folder.
