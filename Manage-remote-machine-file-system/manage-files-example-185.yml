# ===================================================================================
# ðŸ“˜ Purpose:
# This playbook demonstrates how to perform file management tasks using Ansible.
# It covers file creation, content writing, permission changes, existence checking,
# and deletion of files on remote hosts.

# âœ… Key Concepts Covered:
#   - Creating empty and content-rich files
#   - Using `copy`, `file`, and `stat` modules
#   - Managing file permissions
#   - Conditionally executing tasks using `when`
#   - File deletion based on existence
# ===================================================================================

- name: File Management Playbook
  hosts: webservers  # Replace with your target group of managed hosts
  gather_facts: false

  tasks:
    # âœ… Task: Create an empty file using 'touch'
    - name: Create an Empty File
      ansible.builtin.file:
        path: /tmp/empty_file.txt  # Target file path
        state: touch               # Ensures file is created if not exists
      register: result_empty_file  # Captures change result

    # âœ… Task: Print debug message only if file was created
    - debug:
        msg: "Empty file created successfully"
      when: result_empty_file.changed

    # âœ… Task: Create a text file with multiple lines of content
    - name: Create a Text File
      copy:
        content: |
          This is the content
          of the file.
          It can span multiple lines.
        dest: /tmp/text_file.txt    # Destination file path
      register: result_text_file

    # âœ… Task: Print message if text file creation was successful
    - debug:
        msg: "Text file created successfully"
      when: result_text_file.changed

    # âœ… Task: Check if the file exists using the `stat` module
    - name: Check if File Exists
      ansible.builtin.stat:
        path: /tmp/text_file.txt    # Check for this file
      register: file_stat

    # âœ… Task: Inform if the file exists
    - debug:
        msg: "Text file exists"
      when: file_stat.stat.exists

    # âœ… Task: Change permissions of the file to 0600 (rw for owner only)
    - name: Change File Permissions
      ansible.builtin.file:
        path: /tmp/text_file.txt
        mode: '0600'                # Read/write permissions for owner
      register: result_change_permissions

    # âœ… Task: Confirm if file permissions were changed
    - debug:
        msg: "File permissions changed successfully"
      when: result_change_permissions.changed

    # âœ… Task: Delete the file if it exists
    - name: Delete File if Exists
      ansible.builtin.file:
        path: /tmp/text_file.txt
        state: absent              # Ensures the file is deleted
      register: result_delete_file

    # âœ… Task: Confirm deletion
    - debug:
        msg: "File deleted successfully"
      when: result_delete_file.changed
