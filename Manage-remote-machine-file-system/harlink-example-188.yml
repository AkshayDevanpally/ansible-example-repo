# ===================================================================================
# ðŸ“˜ Purpose:
# This playbook demonstrates how to manage hard links in Ansible on a Linux system.
# It covers creating a source file, generating a hard link to it, verifying its existence,
# and then removing the hard link and confirming the deletion.

# âœ… Key Concepts Covered:
#   - Using the `ansible.builtin.file` module to create files and links
#   - Creating hard links (`state: link`)
#   - Verifying file/link existence using the `stat` module
#   - Safely removing files/links
# ===================================================================================

  tasks:
    # âœ… Create a new file to serve as the source for hard link
    - name: Create a file
      ansible.builtin.file:
        path: /tmp/source_file.txt
        state: touch         # Ensures the file exists
        mode: '0644'         # Set appropriate file permissions

    # âœ… Create a hard link pointing to the source file
    - name: Create a hard link to the file

        dest: /tmp/hardlink_to_source
        state: link          # Used for both soft and hard links

    # âœ… Check if the hard link was successfully created
    - name: Verify existence of the hard link
      ansible.builtin.stat:
        path: /tmp/hardlink_to_source
      register: hardlink_info

    # âœ… Print the result of the hard link check
    - name: Print hard link existence
      debug:
        msg: "Hard link exists: {{ hardlink_info.stat.exists }}"

    # âœ… Delete the hard link
    - name: Remove the hard link
      ansible.builtin.file:
        path: /tmp/hardlink_to_source
        state: absent        # Ensures the link is removed

    # âœ… Verify that the hard link was removed
    - name: Verify removal of the hard link
      ansible.builtin.stat:
        path: /tmp/hardlink_to_source
      register: removed_link_info

    # âœ… Print result of the removal check
    - name: Print hard link removal result
      debug:
        msg: "Hard link removed: {{ not removed_link_info.stat.exists }}"
