# ===================================================================================
# ðŸ“˜ Purpose:
# This playbook demonstrates how to manage directories on remote hosts using Ansible.
# It includes directory creation, existence check, renaming, permission changes, 
# and deletion.

# âœ… Key Concepts Covered:
#   - Directory creation and deletion using the `file` module
#   - Renaming using `command` with `mv`
#   - Recursively setting permissions
#   - Existence check with `stat`
#   - Conditional debug messages using `when`
# ===================================================================================
